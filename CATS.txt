Cats are small, carnivorous mammals scientifically known as Felis catus. They have lived alongside humans for thousands of years, cherished both as companions and as natural pest controllers. With their graceful movements, playful nature, and engaging personalities, cats have become one of the world’s most beloved pets.

Physical Characteristics
Cats are known for their agile bodies, sharp retractable claws, and keen senses. They typically weigh between 5 to 20 pounds, with soft fur that comes in a variety of colors and patterns. Their eyes grant them excellent night vision, and their whiskers help them navigate tight spaces.

Behavior and Temperament
Cats are often independent, curious, and intelligent animals. While some cats enjoy being the center of attention, others prefer solitude. Most cats communicate with a combination of vocalizations (meows, purrs, hisses), body language, and scent marking. They are meticulous groomers, spending a significant part of their day cleaning themselves.
